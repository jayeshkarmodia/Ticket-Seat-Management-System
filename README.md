## Database Design

The database contains these 10 tables:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `users` | Customer information |
| `venues` | Physical venues |
| `screens` | Screens/arenas inside venues |
| `seats` | Seats belonging to screens |
| `events` | Movies, concerts, sports, theatre, etc. |
| `shows` | Scheduled occurrence of an event |
| `bookings` | Customer booking |
| `booking_seats` | Seats included in each booking |
| `payments` | Payment information |
| `tickets` | Generated ticket |

## Database Relationships

- One **venue** has many **screens**.
- One **screen** has many **seats**.
- One **event** can have many **shows**.
- One **screen** can host many **shows**.
- One **user** can make many **bookings**.
- One **show** can have many **bookings**.
- One **booking** can contain many **booking_seats**.
- One **seat** can appear in many booking records across different shows.
- A booking can have one payment.
- A booking can generate one ticket.

## Setup

### 1. Start MySQL Server

Make sure your MySQL Server service is running.

### 2. Create the database

Open MySQL Workbench and run:

```sql
SOURCE path/to/database/schema.sql;
```

Or open `database/schema.sql` in Workbench and execute it.

### 3. Add sample data

Run:

```sql
SOURCE path/to/database/sample_data.sql;
```

### 4. Create the application user

If you have not already created it:

```sql
CREATE USER 'ticket_app'@'localhost'
IDENTIFIED BY 'TicketApp@1234';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES
ON ticket_seat_management.*
TO 'ticket_app'@'localhost';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### 5. Install Python dependency

From the project root:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Set database environment variables

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:MYSQL_HOST="localhost"
$env:MYSQL_PORT="3306"
$env:MYSQL_USER="ticket_app"
$env:MYSQL_PASSWORD="TicketApp@1234"
$env:MYSQL_DATABASE="ticket_seat_management"
```

### 7. Run

```powershell
python terminal_app\app.py
```

## Application Flow

### Book Tickets

The application guides the user through:

```text
Select Customer
       Γåô
Select Show
       Γåô
Display Seat Map
       Γåô
Select Available Seats
       Γåô
Show Booking Summary
       Γåô
Confirm
       Γåô
Create Booking
       Γåô
Create Booking Seats
       Γåô
Create Payment
       Γåô
Create Ticket
```

All booking-related inserts are performed in one database transaction.
